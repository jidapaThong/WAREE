Water Level Analysis and Reporting Estimation System

1. The water level estimation AI using image processing and computer vision

Our project focuses on utilizing image processing and computer vision to estimate water levels
by capturing images from positioned surveillance cameras every two minutes, and eliminating the need
for additional installations or the use of alternative water level sensors or equipment. This approach
maximizes the utilization of existing resources. Specifically, the Nakhon municipalityâ€™s pre-installed
surveillance cameras will be leveraged for this purpose. Our project aims to employ image processing techniques to estimate water levels and subsequently store water level data in the database. This
database will facilitate the retrieval and analysis of historical water level records.

2. The notification system

The notification system, utilizing LINE notify, will immediately alert users in case of a zone
change, obtained through image processing, exceeding the predefined threshold. This notification will
inform users of the elevated water levels in the canal, allowing them to prepare and respond promptly
to the situation.

3. The web application

The website serves as a platform for users to access real-time water level data directly from the
homepage, and explore historical water levels through a user-friendly dashboard. Users can view realtime water level data for various camera locations, including zone information. It features a dashboard
that displays a stacked area chart of water levels, highest and lowest water levels based on specified
dates, and a feature to change the language of the content. Furthermore, it provides the option for users
to download historical water level data and a video tutorial explaining how to use the website.
